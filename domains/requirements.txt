Introduction
Background 
WebCollect is a software platform that allows organisations, societies, and associations to easily manage their members, membership programs, and events. WebCollect was founded in 2002 and over time the technology stack on which WebCollect was built has become outdated and the platform has not been maintained well, causing the application to become unstable, unscalable, and generally non-performant. 
This resulted in the business growth stagnating and some customers leaving the platform and the WebCollect brand being damaged. 

Purpose and Goal 
The purpose of this initiative is to develop a new application, Membi, which will be built on a modern technology stack and have a more modern user interface. 
Membi will contain many of the popular features from WebCollect as well as newer features requested by the WebCollect customers. These features will be rolled out in an iterative manner. 

Value Proposition 
The development of the new Membi platform will improve the experience for the existing customers and provide them with new features that will let them get more out of the platform. A modern stable platform will allow the business to pursue new customers and explore new revenue streams that was not available on the old WebCollect platform.

If they choose to renew their subscription, the selected subscription should be replaced with a renewal for the current/recently expired subscription in the cart and should be processed.
